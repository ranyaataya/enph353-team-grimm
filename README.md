ENPH 353 Project September 2019 - December 2019 <br>
Authors: Ranya Ataya & Zach Laskin <br><br>

- License Plates and parking lot ID letters and numbers convolution neural network was written and run in Google Collaboratory: [licensePlates and lotIDs CNN](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ViajBWmqxbqJCaQNv43VCiLeO4HOZuLF) <br>
- All of the data used for training this convolution neural network can be found in this GitHub repo, in the following paths: <br>
enph353-team-grimm/convolutionNN_2_ws/src/convolution_net/scripts/letters_and_numbers/ <br>
enph353-team-grimm/convolutionNN_2_ws/src/convolution_net/scripts/lettersAndNums_brightness/ <br>
- All python scripts used in the final iteration of the project can be found in enph353-team-grimm/convolutionNN_2_ws/src/convolution_net/scripts/ 
<br><br>
- Failed pedestrian convolution neural network: [failed pedestrian CNN](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1H4RLuugelTn0Bq8kwwMiwwlJAlDXAhts). This CNN model was not used in the final iteration of the project due to various issues and we were able to accomplish this without machine learning.
